# **Request for 4 courses in 1st semester**

CS dept **does not** recommend **12-credit hour (or 4 courses)** course load in the 1st semester, UNLESS there is an extraordinary circumstance. 

This is done only on a *student-by-student basis* after the completion of 1st semester, and you will need special approval from your advisor.

We want you to do well in the courses and succeed in the program. Please pace yourself and demonstrate sufficient progress. 😃 👍🏼
