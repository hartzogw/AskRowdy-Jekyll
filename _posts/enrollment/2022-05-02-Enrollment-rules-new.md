<a  href="https://semo.edu/student-support/academic-support/registrar/priority-registration-dates.html" target="blank">Priority Registration Dates | SEMO</a>


**Policies:**


• Contact your graduate advisor by email to reserve an appointment for advising. He/she will let you know how to reserve the appointment.

• Students are no longer required to fill out an advising form. Instead, student need to add courses that he/she are eligible to take as listed in their degree works.

• If a student takes a course that is not listed on their degree works and they did not get prior approval from their advisor, it will not count, and the department will not sub the course. The student will not be refunded.

**Before registration date:**

1- Check your degree works (identify what course you still need to take)

3- Compare the list of courses that you still need to take with the list of available courses and identify the courses. List all possible courses because number of seats are limited and if a class is full, you will need to add your self to another class.

4- Schedule an advising appointment if you have questions. Faculty advisors will let you know how to schedule an appointment.
