<h3>Academic Advising</h3>

Advisors can assist with enrolling in classes, declare/changing your major or minor, and providing overall support to successfully graduate. Academic advisors are available by appointment.

Please reach out to your advisor over *email* or show up during the *office hours*. 

To receive quick responses when you send an email to the academic advisor or administrative assistant ([**csgradprograms@semo.edu**](mailto:csgradprograms@semo.edu)), always send us your **Student SEMO ID and copy of your DegreeWorks**  so that lookup becomes faster. 

Please allow us *24-48 hours* for responding to your email.
