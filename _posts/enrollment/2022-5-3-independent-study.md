# **Independent Study**

### **Can you tell us about Special topics and Independent Study?**

As the name suggests, you will be studying CS/CY topics which are not covered during the regular coursework. 

You can either suggest a topic or approach a professor for potential topics. The evaluation format will be decided by the professor just like a regular coursework.

### Approval process for Independent Study

1. Select the topic for the independent study in consultation with the **instructor**
2. Fill the form and get an approval from the instructor (see below)
3. Schedule a meeting with your **advisor** and get the signature
4. Submit the form to the **department office**
5. This will be sent to the **Department chair** for further evaluation
