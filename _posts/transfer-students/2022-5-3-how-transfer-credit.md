In all cases, over one-half of the coursework required in a degree program must be completed at the Cape Girardeau campus, the universityâ€™s Regional Campuses and Center, or through Southeast Online. Transfer courses do not count toward meeting the residence or 600-level requirements. No more than 12 hours of transfer credit or credit older than 6 years may be applied to a graduate program. Transfer credit must be accepted by the major advisor and is applied to a program at candidacy. Before enrolling for credit at another institution, prior approval must be obtained from the major advisor. Only credit in which a 'B' or better was earned will be accepted for transfer. Credit for transfer is only acceptable if earned from a regionally accredited institution. For programs in education, off-campus credit earned from a non-NCATE accredited institution will not be accepted.
