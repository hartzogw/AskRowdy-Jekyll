12 hours of transfer credit (4 courses) NOT older than 6 years may be applied to a graduate program. - These credits must be related to computer science (any non-cs courses cannot be transferred). - You must have earned a 'B' or higher in the transferable courses. - Transfer courses do not count toward meeting 600-level requirements.
