# Southeast awards more than $20 million in scholorships each year
Scholarships are a form of aid that doesn't require repayment. They're awarded based on a variety of factors including academic achievement, talent, athletic ability, leadership, participation in a specific campus activity, geography, or financial need. 

These Scholarships reflect our investment in your potential.

When you apply to Southeast, we automatically review your application for most of our scholarships and award academic scholarships at the time of admission. Additionally, there are a few things to know: 
- **Test scores can be combined for scholarship purposes.** Did you take the ACT or SAT more than once? We'll combine your best ACT or SAT subscores to make a superscore.
- **Test scores are not required for scholarships.** You've earned great grades, but test taking makes your palms sweat. With a 3.25 high school GPA, you qualify for Copper Dome - no test required.
- **Many scholarships are "stackable".** Many scholarships can be stacked and added together for a larger award. Plus, your need-based aid won't reduce your scholarship value.
- **Scholarships are designed for simple renewal.** Take the appropriate number of credit hours in a year and maintain a select GPA and the renewal process is quick and easy.
