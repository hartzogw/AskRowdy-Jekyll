## Re-Requisite Course Waiver
Students can select any one option:
- Complete a **completion certificate** for the re-requisite courses, which the student has taken in another regionally accredited university 
- Show any evidence in form of a **letter representing significant experience (3+ years)** in programming and introductory Computer Science. This should indicate:
    - Data of service and Scope of work. 
    - Emphasize the student's skills about CS500 and/or CS503 courses above
    - Issued on organization standard letterhead by manager with verifiable contact information
- A **digital artifact** such as git repository, tools developed, website enhancements to prove your experience. 
- Take the **pre-requisite waiver exame** in the Computer Science department about the programming and computing courses and receive a minimum 'B' grade.

## Prereq: Non-CS majors
Students from Non-Computer Science major need to take one or both the pre-requisite courses:
1. CS500: Fundamentals of Programming.
- Algorithms & Data Structures
- Object Oriented Programming
- Discrete Mathematics
- Standard libraries with an emphasis on practical programming
2. CS503: Fundamentals of Computing.
- Computer Organization/Architecture
- Computer Networks
- Algorithms Design & Analysis
- Operating Systems
CS500 and CS503 does not count towards your degree. You are required to complete them before you can start your regular (core/optional) courses.

## Can you waive off my prerequisites courses?

A student can take the prerequisite exams in order to get the prerequisites waived (see below). Please note that the waiver is at the discretion of graduate coordinator/department chair.

<h4>Options for prerequisite course waiver (any ONE):</h4>
- Submit a completioncertificate for the pre-req courses, which the student has taken in another regionally accredited university.
- Show any evidence in form of a letter representing significant experience (3+ years) in programming and introductory Computer Science. This should indicate:
date of service and scope of work.
emphasizes the studentâ€™s skills about CS500 and/or CS503 courses listed above.
issued on organization standard letterhead by manager with verifiable contact information.
A digital artifact such as git repository, tools developed, website enhancements to prove your expertise. 
- Take the prerequisite waiver exam in the Computer Science department about the programming and computing courses and receive a minimum 'B' grade.

> *Please work in consultation with the graduate coordinator.*
