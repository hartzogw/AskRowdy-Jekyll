#### What courses can be transfered?

12 hours of transfer credit (4 courses) NOT older than 6 years may be applied to a graduate program. - These credits must be related to computer science (any non-cs courses cannot be transferred). - You must have earned a 'B' or higher in the transferable courses. - Transfer courses do not count toward meeting 600-level requirements.

#### How to transfer credit?

In all cases, over one-half of the coursework required in a degree program must be completed at the Cape Girardeau campus, the university’s Regional Campuses and Center, or through Southeast Online. Transfer courses do not count toward meeting the residence or 600-level requirements. No more than 12 hours of transfer credit or credit older than 6 years may be applied to a graduate program. Transfer credit must be accepted by the major advisor and is applied to a program at candidacy. Before enrolling for credit at another institution, prior approval must be obtained from the major advisor. Only credit in which a 'B' or better was earned will be accepted for transfer. Credit for transfer is only acceptable if earned from a regionally accredited institution. For programs in education, off-campus credit earned from a non-NCATE accredited institution will not be accepted.
