Usually for grad-level courses, most of the faculty provides slides and other reference links and handouts on the course page.So, cost of each course is minimal to nil.  

You may choose to purchase second hand textbooks on Amazon, Ebay, etc., if necessary. 

Similarly, software requirements instructions will vary from course to another. The costs are minimal as each instructor will provide you the links and download instructions for their favorite open source software or virtual machine. 

However, you may have to get your own laptop, because most of the assignments will be online.
