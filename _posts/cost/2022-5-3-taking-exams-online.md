Instructor will inform you about how you will be taking online exams. 
For Example : 
- Exam duration: 24-48 hours (depending on instructor)
- Exam deliverables: Submit your completed work (e.g. pdf or code files)

Please remember that exams are just one part of evaluation. Homework, quiz, project and forum participation are also part of evaluation.
