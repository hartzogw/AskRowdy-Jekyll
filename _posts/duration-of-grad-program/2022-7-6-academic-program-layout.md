For year 1, total 6 courses can be taken where 2 courses are core and 1 course is elective for each semester during Spring and Fall. 

Howerver, there are two options for Year 2. the option 1 is  to enroll 1 and 2 elective courses in Spring and only 1 core course is needed to enroll in Fall. As option 2, it is required to enroll 2 core and 1 elective course in  Fall.
