Students from Non-Computer Science majors need to take one *or* both of the pre-requisite courses:

## CS500: Fundamentals of Programming 
- Algorithms & Data Structures 
- Object Oriented Programming 
- Discrete Mathematics 
- Standard libraries with an emphasis on practical programming 

## CS503: Fundamentals of Computing
- Computer Organizaiton/Architecture 
- Computer Networks 
- Algorithms Design & Analysis 
- Operating Systems 

> CS500 and CS503 does not count towards your degree. You are **required to** compete them before you can start your regular (core/optional) courses.

## Re-Requisite Course Waiver
Students can select any one option:
- Complete a **completion certificate** for the re-requisite courses, which the student has taken in another regionally accredited university 
- Show any evidence in form of a **letter representing significant experience (3+ years)** in programming and introductory Computer Science. This should indicate:
    - Data of service and Scope of work. 
    - Emphasize the student's skills about CS500 and/or CS503 courses above
    - Issued on organization standard letterhead by manager with verifiable contact information
- A **digital artifact** such as git repository, tools developed, website enhancements to prove your experience. 
- Take the **pre-requisite waiver exame** in the Computer Science department about the programming and computing courses and receive a minimum 'B' grade.
