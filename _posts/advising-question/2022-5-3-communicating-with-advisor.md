Please reach out to your advisor over *email* or show up during the *office hours*. 

To receive quick responses when you send an email to the academic advisor or administrative assistant (csgradprograms@semo.edu), always send us your **Student SEMO ID and copy of your DegreeWorks**  so that lookup becomes faster. 

Please allow us *24-48 hours* for responding to your email.
