 Optional Practical Training (OPT) provides F-1 students with an opportunity
                    for hands-on work experience (work authorization) related to the academic field of study.

<h3>You are eligible to apply if you meet the following criteria: </h3>

<li><span>You are currently in active F-1 status.</span></li>
<li><span>You have been enrolled in a full course of study for one academic year in the U.S. or will complete one academic year by the date the OPT approval begins.</span></li>
<li><span>You have not exceeded 12 months of full-time Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization. (Part-time CPT does not affect OPT eligibility.)</span></li>
<li><span>You do not need a job offer first; you can apply for the 12-month OPT authorization without a job offer.</span></li>
<li><span>You have not previously completed 12 months of OPT at the same degree level.</span></li>
<li><span>You are eligible for 12 months of full-time OPT per academic level. For example, you may apply for 12 months of OPT after completing a bachelor's degree and then another 12 months after completing a master's degree. Extensions may be granted to students in STEM fields. See the “STEM OPT Resources” link for more information.</span></li>
<li><span>You may apply for OPT authorization during your academic program, after your program completion, or a combination of both.</span></li> <br>
